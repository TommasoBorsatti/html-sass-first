      <h2>To One in Paradise</h2>
      <h3>By Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
      <p>Thou wast that all to me, love,<br>For which my soul did pine—<br>A green isle in the sea, love,<br>A fountain and a shrine,<br>All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,<br>And all the flowers were mine.<br>Ah, dream too bright to last!<br>Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise<br>But to be overcast!<br>A voice from out the Future cries,<br>“On! on!”—but o’er the Past<br>(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies<br>Mute, motionless, aghast!<br>For, alas! alas! with me<br>The light of Life is o’er!<br>No more—no more—no more—<br>(Such language holds the solemn sea<br>To the sands upon the shore)<br>Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,<br>Or the stricken eagle soar!<br>And all my days are trances,<br>And all my nightly dreams<br>Are where thy grey eye glances,<br>And where thy footstep gleams—<br>In what ethereal dances,<br>By what eternal streams.</p>

      <h2>When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</h2>
      <h3>Walt Whitman</h3>
      <p>When I heard the learn’d astronomer,<br>When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,<br>When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,<br>When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,<br>How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,<br>Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,<br>In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,<br>Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.</p>
